# notes
bad idea. very complicated to orchestrate as it grows or needs change. https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/#:~:text=It's%20ok%20to%20have%20multiple,defined%20networks%20and%20shared%20volumes.

you can't use localhost. not supported by sauce mobile.
use wget/curl to obtain binaries needed. 
launch container, with services starting sequentially in the background.
